# üìö Pipeline Execution Framework

This project is structured around two main core components: **Pipeline** and **Task**.

The architecture ensures a **clear separation of concerns**, **modularity**, and **extensibility**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Concepts

### 1. Pipeline

A **Pipeline** is an abstract execution orchestrator.  
It manages a **sequence of tasks**, executing each task **in order**, and passing the **output of the previous task** as the **input to the next one**.

Responsibilities of a Pipeline:
- Validate the sequence of tasks.
- Execute tasks sequentially.
- Manage the flow of data across tasks.

The Pipeline does not implement business logic itself ‚Äî it only controls the execution flow.

---

### 2. Task

A **Task** represents a **unit of work** within a pipeline.  
However, a Task **does not implement specific business logic directly**.

Instead:
- It defines the **expected parameters**, **input data**, and **output data**.
- It **receives a class instance** during initialization, which implements the actual **business logic**.
- It is responsible for:
  - Validating input data.
  - Instantiating and running the provided class.
  - Validating output data.

Thus, the Task provides a **standardized execution interface**, while delegating specific behavior to an injected **business logic class**.

# üìú Design by Contract

This project follows a **Design by Contract** philosophy to ensure robust collaboration between components.

In this architecture:

- **Pipelines** expect that the **Tasks** they orchestrate correctly implement the task interface (providing task definitions and execution order).
- **Tasks** expect that the **business operation classes** they receive correctly implement the required **contract**, specifically a `run(input_data)` method.
- **Business logic classes** (located in the `operations/` folder) must fulfill this contract, providing reliable input/output behavior without breaking the expected data flow.

‚úÖ **Contracts are not enforced by strict inheritance**, but by respecting **clear expectations** (interfaces by behavior, not necessarily abstract classes).

‚úÖ **Tasks validate input data and output data** before and after invoking the `run()` method, ensuring that all parties respect the agreed-upon data formats and types.

## üî• Why Design by Contract?

| Principle | Application in this Project |
|:----------|:-----------------------------|
| **Clear Expectations** | Each layer defines *what* it expects from the others, minimizing surprises. |
| **Robustness** | If a component misbehaves (wrong type, wrong output), validation catches it immediately. |
| **Loose Coupling** | Business logic classes can change freely as long as they respect the contract, without breaking the pipeline or tasks. |
| **Testability** | Each component can be unit-tested independently, knowing exactly what is expected. |

---

## üìö Example of the Contract

A class provided to a Task must:

- Implement a method `run(input_data)`.
- Receive validated input data.
- Return output data matching the expected format.

## üî• Example Workflow

Suppose we have a task called `ExtractDataFromFileTask`:

- **Input:** a Pydantic model representing a document (e.g., `DocumentFile`).
- **Output:** a JSON-like dictionary containing extracted data.
- **Business Logic:** provided by a class (e.g., `FileExtractor`) passed during initialization.
