"""
Pipeline Module

This module defines the Pipeline class, responsible for orchestrating tasks.
It is designed as a generic infrastructure component, agnostic to business logic.

IMPORTANT:
- This class should remain business-logic free.
- Changes to this module may affect all pipelines across the system.
- Ensure 100% test coverage and backward compatibility before modifying.
